# My Python Assignment: File Read & Write with PDF Output + Error Handling
## Introduction
This repository contains a Python program I created as part of an assignment to practice file handling, error handling, and writing to PDF files in Python. The program reads text from a file, modifies it by adding line numbers, and then saves the result into a properly formatted PDF document.

## Assignment Objective
The main goals of this task were:
Learn how to read text files in Python
Modify file content (e.g., add line numbers)
Write the modified content into a new file
Handle errors gracefully (like missing or unreadable files)
Upgrade the program to generate a real PDF file instead of just plain text

## Program Description
Here’s what the program does:
Asks the user to enter the name of a text file to read
Reads all the lines from the file
Adds line numbers to each line
Asks the user for an output PDF filename (e.g., new-file.pdf)
Writes the modified content into a properly formatted PDF document

## What I Learned
From this assignment, I gained experience in:
Reading and modifying text files
Writing formatted text into a PDF file with reportlab
Using loops to add line numbers
Handling errors gracefully with try...except blocks
Understanding how page layout works when generating PDFs
